How to modify interior layout files.

Interior layout files (.ilf) describe the placement of static objects inside a
building, cave, bunker... Static objects are those that users cannot
move/destroy (i.e. chairs/plants/banners in starports, hotels,...)

The first thing you need to do is to gain access to the interior layout files.
Use your favorite .tre archive extraction program. Linux users can use
this: home.earthlink.net/~xunil/treLib.tgz Windows users will need to
search, but the tools are out there.

For this how-to, I chose interiorlayout/theed_hangar2.ilf from the file
patch_00.tre.

You will also need to download readSWG:
Linux users: home.earthlink.net/~xunil/meshLib.tgz
Windows users: home.earthlink.net/~xunil/readSWG.exe
(Note that readSWG.exe runs well on linux when using a recent version of wine)

Currently readSWG can read several formats, but only write interior layout
(.ilf) files.

- Run './readSWG interiorlayout/theed_hangar2.ilf > theed_hangar2_ilf.txt'

- Using your favorite text editor edit the file theed_hangar2_ilf.txt.

- Search for the word 'fountain'

You will find a block of text that looks like this:

Object Filename: object/static/structure/naboo/shared_fountain_naboo_style_1.iff
Object Zone: lobby
Transform matrix:
  1.000000 0.000000 0.000000 0.000000
  0.000000 1.000000 0.000000 -0.026396
  0.000000 0.000000 1.000000 -67.000000

Now if you don't understand 3d tranformation matrices, read this:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_projection#First_step:_world_transform

Ok, you say that the matrix in the article is a 4x4 and the one in the file is
a 3x4. The last row of the file matrix should be assumed to be 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0

The first thing we are going to do is replace the naboo fountain with a
corellian one.

Change this line:

Object Filename: object/static/structure/naboo/shared_fountain_naboo_style_1.iff

to this line:

Object Filename: object/static/structure/corellia/shared_corl_fountain_statue_heroic_s01.iff

Now to put the fountain someplace new. While in the game, enter the instance
you want to modify. In this case, the Theed starport. Press Ctrl-Shift-G,
you will now get a small window that tells you your location among other
things. The line named 'Player Cell' is what you are interested in. I chose
a position in the hangar.

You can see my coords in the upper left of this screenshot:
http://home.earthlink.net/~xunil/interiorMod02.jpg

My player cell line looks like this:
Player Cell: 0.2 7.9 -22.2 -6 thm_nboo_thed_hangar hangar

0.2, 7.9 and -22.2 are the x,y,z coordinates respectively.
-6 is your character's heading.
thm_nboo_thed_hangar is the interior
hangar is the zone inside the current interior

With this new information, we will modify the block to look like this:

Object Filename: object/static/structure/corellia/shared_corl_fountain_statue_heroic_s01.iff
Object Zone: hangar
Transform matrix:
  1.000000 0.000000 0.000000 0.200000
  0.000000 1.000000 0.000000 7.900000
  0.000000 0.000000 1.000000 -22.200000
Now its time to compile our changes back into a .ilf file.

- Run './readSWG create theed_hangar2_ilf.txt interiorlayout/theed_hangar2.ilf'

- Assuming that interiorlayout/theed_hangar2.ilf is in your StarWarsGalaxies
directory, run the client.

- Upon entering the Theed space port you will notice the fountain in the lobby
is gone. A quick jog up to the hangar and you will see this:
http://home.earthlink.net/~xunil/interiorMod03.jpg

If you don't want to move the fountain you can just delete the record shown
above and reconstruct the ilf.

Remember this is a client side modification. So only you will see the
change. I'm sure eventually the server will be able to push its own .tre
patches and distribute changes like this.

In the meantime, have fun redecorating your starports, hotels, caves,
cantinas,...
