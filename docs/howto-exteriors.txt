How to modify exterior files.

World snapshot files (.ws) describe the placement of static objects in a
zone. Static objects are those that users cannot move/destroy (i.e.
 chairs/plants/buildings...)

The first thing you need to do is to gain access to the snapshot files.
Use your favorite .tre archive extraction program. Linux users can use
this: home.earthlink.net/~xunil/treLib.tgz Windows users will need to
search, but the tools are out there.

For this how-to, I chose snapshot/naboo.ws from the file
patch_13_00.tre.

You will also need to download readSWG:
Linux users: home.earthlink.net/~xunil/meshLib.tgz
Windows users: home.earthlink.net/~xunil/readSWG.exe
(Note that readSWG.exe runs well on linux when using a recent version of wine)

Currently readSWG can read several formats, but only write interior layout
(.ilf) files and snapshot (.ws) files

- Run './readSWG snapshot/naboo.ws > naboo_ws.txt'

- Using your favorite text editor edit the file naboo_ws.txt.

- Search for the word 'hangar'

You will find a block of text that looks like this:

Node ID: 1692099
Parent node ID: 0
Object index: 212
Object filename: object/building/naboo/shared_hangar_naboo_theed.iff
Position in parent: 0
Rotation about X(deg): 53.7689
Rotation about Y(deg): 0
Rotation about Z(deg): 19.7918
Unknown 1: 0
X(m): -4795.27
Y(m): 5.94832
Z(m): 4238.79
Unknown 2: 512
Unknown 3: 1195348352
level: 0

The first thing we are going to do is replace the Naboo hangar with a
standard starport.

Change these lines:

Object index: 212
Object filename: object/building/naboo/shared_hangar_naboo_theed.iff

to these lines:

Object index: 237
Object filename: object/building/naboo/shared_starport_naboo.iff


-----------------------------

Now to put the fountain someplace new. While in the game, enter the instance
you want to modify. In this case, the Theed starport. Press Ctrl-Shift-G,
you will now get a small window that tells you your location among other
things. The line named 'Player Cell' is what you are interested in. I chose
a position in the hangar.

You can see my coords in the upper left of this screenshot:
http://home.earthlink.net/~xunil/interiorMod02.jpg

My player cell line looks like this:
Player Cell: 0.2 7.9 -22.2 -6 thm_nboo_thed_hangar hangar

0.2, 7.9 and -22.2 are the x,y,z coordinates respectively.
-6 is your character's heading.
thm_nboo_thed_hangar is the interior
hangar is the zone inside the current interior

With this new information, we will modify the block to look like this:

Object Filename: object/static/structure/corellia/shared_corl_fountain_statue_heroic_s01.iff
Object Zone: hangar
Transform matrix:
  1.000000 0.000000 0.000000 0.200000
  0.000000 1.000000 0.000000 7.900000
  0.000000 0.000000 1.000000 -22.200000
Now its time to compile our changes back into a .ilf file.

- Run './readSWG create theed_hangar2_ilf.txt interiorlayout/theed_hangar2.ilf'

- Assuming that interiorlayout/theed_hangar2.ilf is in your StarWarsGalaxies
directory, run the client.

- Upon entering the Theed space port you will notice the fountain in the lobby
is gone. A quick jog up to the hangar and you will see this:
http://home.earthlink.net/~xunil/interiorMod03.jpg

If you don't want to move the fountain you can just delete the record shown
above and reconstruct the ilf.

Remember this is a client side modification. So only you will see the
change. I'm sure eventually the server will be able to push its own .tre
patches and distribute changes like this.

In the meantime, have fun redecorating your starports, hotels, caves,
cantinas,...
