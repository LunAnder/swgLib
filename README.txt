swgLib (formerly meshLib) is a library I started for the purpose of figuring
out the Star Wars Galaxies file formats.  This library is by no means
complete. In some cases it will only dump out the data to the console.  I'm
still decoding file formats so expect this library to change as I figure more
out.  If you figure out anything thats missing, please let me know so
I can integrate it into the core code.

I only work on linux, so the windows build files are very out of
date.  If any windows developer feels like updating them, let me know
and I will include the new build files into the package.  I may not
work in windows, but I try to write cross-platform friendly code.  So
if you have any portability issues with building under windows let me know and
I'll fix the code.

The latest version of this code is available at:
