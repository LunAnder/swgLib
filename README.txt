This is a library I started for the purpose of figuring out the Star
Wars Galaxies mesh file format.  As I got into it, I started decoding
more files and never got around to changing the original name of the
library.  So regardless of the name, meshLib can handle more than
just the .msh files.  This library is by no means complete.  In some
cases it will only dump out the data to the console.  I'm still
decoding file formats so expect this library to change as I figure more
out.  If you figure out anything thats missing, please let me know so
I can integrate it into the core code.

I only work on linux, so the windows build files are very out of
date.  If any windows developer feels like updating them, let me know
and I will include the new build files into the package.  I may not
work in windows, but I try to write cross-platform friendly code.  So
if you have any portability issues with building under windows let me know and
I'll fix the code.
